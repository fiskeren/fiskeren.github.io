      <title>Creating Standalone Artifact Collector</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received several positive reactions to my last post about how to perform dead host collections. Therefore, I wanted to follow it up with another post on how to create a standalone collector that can gather artefacts from a running host using Velociraptor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.velociraptor.app/&#34;&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent DFIR tool designed to efficiently provide visibility into endpoints. It can operate in a server-agent setup, functioning essentially as an EDR—without the AV, of course—with thousands of hosts. Additionally, it can also serve as a standalone artefact collector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deadhost Investigation and Super Timeline</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently attended a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-incident-response-threat-hunting-training/&#34;&gt;SANS 508&lt;/a&gt; course and got time to play around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.velociraptor.app/&#34;&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/a&gt;, which is an awesome DFIR tool made to efficiently get visibility into endpoints. It can be run in a server/agent setup, essentially working as an EDR with thousands of hosts, and it can also be used as a standalone artifact collector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain how to use the Velociraptor executable as a artefact collector to quickly collect Windows artefacts from a dead host image. After collecting the artefacts, I will show how to create a super timeline using &lt;a href=&#34;https://plaso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sources/user/Using-log2timeline.html&#34;&gt;Plaso log2timeline&lt;/a&gt; from the evidence collected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
