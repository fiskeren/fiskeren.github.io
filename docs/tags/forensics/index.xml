      <description>I got quite a few positive reactions to my last post about how to do deadhost collections, so I thought I wanted to follow it up with another post about how to create a standalone collector that can collect artefacts from a running host using Velociraptor.
Velociraptor is an awesome DFIR tool made to efficiently get visibility into endpoints. It can be run in a server/agent setup, essentially working as an EDR with thousands of hosts, and it can also be used as a standalone artefact collector.</description>

      <description>I recently attended a SANS 508 course and got time to play around with Velociraptor, which is an awesome DFIR tool made to efficiently get visibility into endpoints. It can be run in a server/agent setup, essentially working as an EDR with thousands of hosts, and it can also be used as a standalone artifact collector.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain how to use the Velociraptor executable as a artefact collector to quickly collect Windows artefacts from a dead host image.</description>
